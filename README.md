# EEE4113F_Group_27_Design_Project

# This Project investigates the design of a low-cost camera trap with modern features aimed at wildlife research.
### The ESP32CAM board was chosen for development of a first prototype.

## This project was broken into four submodules:
### Camera, Processor, Wireless Transmission
### Sensing
### Power Requirements
### Mechanical Design


### Code References
#### Camera, Processor, Wireless Transmission
